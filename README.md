# Django Project Documentation

## Overview

Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it handles much of the hassle of web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. It’s free and open source.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- pip (Python package installer)
- virtualenv (optional but recommended)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Installing Django

First, ensure you have Python installed. Then, you can install Django using pip:

```bash
pip install django
```

### 2. Creating a Django Project

Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it. Then, create a new Django project:

```bash
django-admin startproject myproject
cd myproject
```

### 3. Running the Development Server

Navigate into your project directory and start the development server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

You should see output indicating the server is running, and you can view your site at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

## Application Structure

A typical Django project structure looks like this:

```
myproject/
    manage.py
    myproject/
        __init__.py
        settings.py
        urls.py
        wsgi.py
    myapp/
        migrations/
        __init__.py
        admin.py
        apps.py
        models.py
        tests.py
        views.py
        templates/
            myapp/
                index.html
```

### `manage.py`

A command-line utility that lets you interact with this Django project.

### `myproject/settings.py`

Settings/configuration for this Django project. This is where Django settings such as database configuration, installed apps, and middleware are defined.

### `myproject/urls.py`

The URL declarations for this Django project; a "table of contents" of your Django-powered site.

### `myproject/wsgi.py`

An entry-point for WSGI-compatible web servers to serve your project.

### `myapp/`

A Django application; a web application that does something. This is where you put the models, views, templates, and static files for your app.

## Creating a New Application

To create a new application within your project, run:

```bash
python manage.py startapp myapp
```

Add your new app to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list in `settings.py`:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'myapp',
]
```

## Models

Models are Python classes that represent database tables. Define your models in `myapp/models.py`.

```python
from django.db import models

class Person(models.Model):
    first_name = models.CharField(max_length=30)
    last_name = models.CharField(max_length=30)
    birth_date = models.DateField()
```

Run `makemigrations` and `migrate` to create the corresponding database tables:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

## Views

Views are Python functions that take web requests and return web responses. Define your views in `myapp/views.py`.

```python
from django.shortcuts import render
from .models import Person

def index(request):
    people = Person.objects.all()
    return render(request, 'myapp/index.html', {'people': people})
```

## Templates

Templates are HTML files that render your data. Place your templates in `myapp/templates/myapp/`.

Example `index.html`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>People</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>People List</h1>
    <ul>
        {% for person in people %}
        <li>{{ person.first_name }} {{ person.last_name }}</li>
        {% endfor %}
    </ul>
</body>
</html>
```

## URL Configuration

Map your view to a URL in `myapp/urls.py`.

```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.index, name='index'),
]
```

Include your app’s URLs in the project’s `urls.py`:

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import include, path

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('myapp/', include('myapp.urls')),
]
```

## Deployment

For deployment, you typically use a WSGI server such as Gunicorn, along with a web server like Nginx. Here’s a brief outline of steps for deploying a Django project:

1. **Set up your server** (Ubuntu, for example).
2. **Install necessary packages** (Python, pip, virtualenv, etc.).
3. **Clone your project** from a version control system (like Git).
4. **Set up a virtual environment** and install your dependencies:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. **Collect static files**:

    ```bash
    python manage.py collectstatic
    ```

6. **Set up the database** (migrations):

    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

7. **Configure Gunicorn** to serve your application.
8. **Set up Nginx** to reverse proxy to Gunicorn.
9. **Secure your application** (optional but recommended) using HTTPS (Let’s Encrypt).

This is a basic outline, and actual deployment may require additional steps and configurations based on your specific environment and requirements.
